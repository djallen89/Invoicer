# Invoicer

Invoicer is a simple tool to construct invoices. Invoices are saved in
JSON format.

## Planned Features:

  of the two.
* Create Invoices by inputting information about yourself, the client,
  billing rates and line items.
* Export to PDF, TeX and Markdown
* Preview invoices in PDF format
